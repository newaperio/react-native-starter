_Mockup by [Previewed]_

This repo contains the base app we use to get our React Native apps started at [NewAperio].

The goal of this repo is to enable our development teams to start fast with a solid foundation. This app is updated with new releases and includes the boilerplate configuration we typically use when bootstrapping new products.

## Technologies

This project bootstraps the following technologies using our defaults:

- [React Native] for developing cross-platform mobile apps
- [TypeScript] for writing type-safe JavaScript
- [Apollo Client] for declaratively fetching data from a GraphQL API
- [Storybook] for isolating components during development and QA
- [React Navigation] for routing and navigation
- [react-native-svg] for SVG support
- [react-native-config] for exposing environment variables
- [Babel] for next generation JavaScript compilation
- [Metro] for code-bundling
- [Jest] for testing
- [Sentry] for error reporting
- [asdf] for managing runtime versions
- [Tailwind React Native Classnames], a styling toolkit based on [TailwindCSS]
- [FontAwesome], an extensive icon set
- [GitHub Actions] for CI
- A suite of code quality tools:
  - [ESLint] for code linting
  - [Prettier] for code formatting
  - [EditorConfig] to maintain code style across editors

## Usage

The repo is setup as a [GitHub template] to make it easy to get started.

1. Click the ["Use this template" button]. This will setup a new repo with a clean history.
2. Clone the new repo locally.
3. Run the init script to rename the starter project and do some other housekeeping: `$ ./bin/init.sh MyApp com.mycompany`.
4. Commit the result: `$ git add --all . && git commit -m "Initalize starter project"`.
