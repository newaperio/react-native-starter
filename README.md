# React Native Starter

This repo contains the base app we use to get our React Native apps started at [NewAperio].

The goal of this repo is to enable our development teams to start fast with a solid foundation. This app is updated with new releases and includes the boilerplate configuration we typically use when bootstrapping new products.
